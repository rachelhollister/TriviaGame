# TriviaGame
Timed trivia game using JavaScript for logic &amp; JQuery to manipulate HTML

My theme is based on the TV Series created by David Lynch, Twin Peaks. Keeping in mind that the application had to be timed, I created 10 questions with a timer of 100 seconds. The player has 100 seconds to answer all 10 questions. At the end of the trivia it will inform them of their score. 

Option to restart the game and try for a better score. Or when time is up an alert will let the player know, and it restarts the game.
